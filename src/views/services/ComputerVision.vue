    question: "What are the key stages of a computer vision-based project?",
    answer:
      "First, we analyze the requirements and give an estimation. During the project setup, we choose the development model and build the team. We move to agile project development (progress reporting during each iteration and testing). Then we do the final testing and collect the feedback. Post-project support is offered upon the project completion.",
